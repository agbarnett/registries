```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, comment='', dpi=400)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# create the diagram
source('3_plot_excluded.R')
```

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=7}
layout(mat=t(1:2))
make_diagram_anzctr()
make_diagram_clintrials()
```

The numbers available for the actual-to-target ratio analysis are smaller because studies had to provided data for both the actual and sample size.
